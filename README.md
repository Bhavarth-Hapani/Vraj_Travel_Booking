3) Setup Instructions

1. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows, use:
venv\Scripts\activate


2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries from requirements.txt.
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set Up the Database
By default, the application uses SQLite, but it can be configured for PostgreSQL or other databases. Run the following commands to set up the database schema:
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade


4. Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file at the root of your project and add your environment variables such as secret keys, database URLs, mail server configurations, etc.


FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///site.db


5. Run the Application
Start the Flask development server:


flask run
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

6. Admin Panel
This project utilizes the default admin panel provided by Flask for managing the application's backend. The admin panel allows easy management of the application's models and data without the need for custom admin UI development. Key features of the default admin panel include:

User Management: Manage user accounts, including creating, editing, and deleting user data.
Data Management: View, add, edit, and delete records for models such as Booking, Contact, and other services.
CRUD Operations: Perform standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database models through an intuitive interface.
Security: Access to the admin panel is restricted to authorized users only, ensuring secure data management.
To access the admin panel, navigate to the specified admin URL after starting the Flask server and log in with the credentials provided.


4) How to Use
Register/Login: Start by creating an account or logging in if you already have one.
Search for Travel Services: Use the search functionality to find flights, hotels, or PackageDeal based on your preferences.
Book Travel: Once you've found a suitable option, proceed with the booking by following the on-screen instructions.
Manage Bookings: After booking, you can visit the "My Profile" page to view, edit, or cancel your bookings.
Admin Panel: (For Admin) Manage the travel services and users through the admin panel, including adding new options or modifying existing ones.
